                              England. <br />
                              Mary Russell was the youngest child of
                              the Rev. Dr. Richard Russell and
                              his second wife, Mary Dicker; she was born about 1750 in Ashe, Hampshire. (Her
                              birth date is as yet unverified; period sources indicate that she was ten years
                              older than her husband George, born in 1760.) Through the Russells, she was a
                              distant relation of the Dukes of Bedford (sixth creation, 1694). She had two
                              siblings, Charles William and Frances; both predeceased her and their parents,
                              which resulted in Mary Russell inheriting
                              her family’s entire estate upon her mother’s death in 1785. Her father’s rectory in
                              Ashe was only a
                              short distance from Steventon, and so she was acquainted
                              with the young Jane Austen. She married
                              George Mitford or Midford on October 17, 1785 at New Alresford,
                              Hampshire. On the marriage allegation papers, both gave their
                              addresses as Old Alresford. Their only daughter,
                              Mary Russell Mitford, was born two years
                              later on December 16, 1787 at New
                              Alresford, Hampshire. Mary
                              Russell died on January 2, 1830 at
                              Three Mile Cross in the parish of Shinfield,

                                 of the Thames and the River Kennet. The town developed as a river port and in
                                 Mitford’s time served as a staging point on
                                 the Bath Road and was developing into a center of manufacturing. Mitford lived here
                                 with her parents from 1791 to 1795, on Coley Avenue in the parish of St.
                                 Mary’s and attended the Abbey School. The family returned to Reading from 1797 to
                                 about 1804, after which they
                                 relocated to Bertram House. They
                                 frequently visited Reading thereafter from their homes at nearby Bertram House, Three
                                 Mile Cross and Swallowfield. Mitford later used scenes from Reading as the basis for

                              Close friend, literary mentor, and frequent correspondent of Mary Russell Mitford.
                              A native of Reading, Talfourd was educated at the Reading’s newly-established Mill
                              Hill school, a
                              dissenting academy, from 1808 to 1810. He attended Dr. Richard Valpy’s Reading School
                              from 1810 to 1812. His career in law began with a legal apprenticeship with Joseph
                              Christy, special pleader, in
                              1817. He was called to the bar in London in 1821 and ultimately earned a
                              D.C.L. (Doctor of Civil Laws) from Oxford on June 20, 1844. While
                              establishing his practice as a barrister and special pleader, he worked as
                              legal correspondent for The
                              Times, reporting on the Oxford
                              Circuit, and also continued his literary interests. After 1833,
                              he was appointed Serjeant at Law, as well as a King’s and Queen’s Counsel.
                              He was elected and served as Member of Parliament for
                              Reading
                              from 1835 to 1841 and from 1847 to 1849
                              ; he served with Charles Fyshe
                              Palmer, Charles Russell, and
                              Francis Piggott. Highlights of his political and
                              legal career included introducing the first copyright bill
                              into Parliament in 1837 (for which action Charles
                              Dickens dedicated Pickwick Papers
                              to him) and defending Edward
                              Moxon’s publication of Percy Shelley’s
                              Queen Mab in 1841
                              . He was appointed Queen’s Serjeant in 1846
                              and Judge of Common Pleas in 1849
                              , at which post he served until his death in 1854. He
                              was knighted in 1850
                              .
                              Talfourd’s literary works include his plays 
                              Ion (1835),

                              Mitford’s time served as a staging point on
                              the Bath Road and was developing into a center of manufacturing. Mitford lived here
                              with her parents from 1791 to 1795, on Coley Avenue in the parish of St.
                              Mary’s and attended the Abbey School. The family returned to Reading from 1797 to
                              about 1804, after which they
                              relocated to Bertram House. They
