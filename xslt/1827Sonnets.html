            <h2>Sonnets from <i>Dramatic Scenes, Sketches, and Other Poems</i></h2>
            <p>Edited by <span class="context" title="person">Lisa M. Wilson<span class="si">Lisa M. Wilson, Managing Editor, Bibliography and Correspondence, Founding Editor, 
                     State University of New York at Potsdam
                     <br/>Lisa M. Wilson is Professor in the Department of English and Communication at SUNY
                     Potsdam, where she has taught since 2005. Her areas of interest include transatlantic
                     Romantic and Victorian era literature, particularly women’s  writing and popular forms
                     such as the Gothic novel and the literary ballad. She is also interested in book history
                     and bibliographical studies, particularly in the study of authorship in the long nineteenth
                     century (1780-1900). She has published in <span class="context" title="title">European Romantic Review</span>, <span class="context" title="title">Romanticism on the Net</span> (now <span class="context" title="title">RaVon</span>), <span class="context" title="title">Romantic Circles</span>, <span class="context" title="title">Romantic Textualities</span>, and elsewhere. She is currently working on a monograph on Romantic-period authorship
                     and literary celebrity. Her work on Digital Mitford thus far includes editing and
                     coding Mitford’s <span class="context" title="title">Introduction</span> to her collected <span class="context" title="title">Dramatic Works</span> (1854), a critical memoir that recounts the author’s influences and experiences at
                     Covent Garden and Drury Lane in the 1820s and 30s. It also includes researching Mitford’s
                     publication history for the site’s working bibliography, particularly tracking the
                     migration of Mitford’s stories from their first publication to their later reappearances
                     in collections and periodicals. A Founding Editor of Digital Mitford, she and her
                     teams of student research assistants have been at work since 2013 on transcribing,
                     coding, and researching Mitford’s letters from 1819 to the early 1820s and on Mitford’s
                     early poems.

                                 oak, although the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) is also native to the Europe and the
                                 UK. Large, long-lived deciduous hardwood tree with lobed leaves, hanging catkins in
                                 spring, and then acorns, oval nuts with woody caps. In 19th-century English forests,
                                 oak was the predominant deciduous tree, often found with <span class="context" title="nature">ash</span> and <span class="context" title="nature">elm</span>. A hard wood with a distinctive light-and-dark grain, used since the early medieval
                                 period for making sturdy furniture, flooring, doors, household items such as chests
                                 and buckets, and for building sailing ships, particularly large naval vessels. Because
                                 the tree is large, strong and long-lived, it has accumulated numerous symbolic and
                                 national associations, particularly in the UK. In English folklore, Robin Hood hid
                                 in an oak to escape pursuers, and the oak became a national symbol after the future
                                 <span class="context" title="person">Charles II</span> reportedly hid in an oak during the English Civil Wars. This tree became known as the Royal Oak, and led to a national celebration of Oak Apple Day in May. <q>Royal Oak</q> became a popular pub name, as well as the name of several Royal Navy warships. The
                                 symbolic association between Britain's military strength and the strength of its men
                                 is encapsulated in the song <span class="context" title="title">Heart of Oak</span>, written in 1759 and revised in 1809: <q>Heart of oak are our ships,/Hearts of oak are our men</q>. Oak leaves, like laurel, were used as ceremonial wreaths and crowns, and both oak
                                 leaves and acorns appeared as neoclassical ornaments. The proverb <q>great oaks from little acorns grow</q>, dates from at least the 16th century, and the concept appears in Chaucer's <span class="context" title="title">Troilus and Criseyde</span>.

Domesticated pigeons such as carrier, homing, and racing pigeons are species of
                                 the rock dove. In Britain, the <span class="context" title="nature">wood pigeon</span> is hunted as a game bird and domesticated pigeons were also used as food. In the
                                 ancient world, doves were associated with goddesses of love, sexuality, and maternity,
                                 such as Inanna Ishtar and Aphrodite. Doves carry symbolic significance in both the
                                 Old and New Testaments of the Hebrew Bible: in Genesis in the story of Noah and the
                                 ark as a symbol of peace and deliverance, in the Song of Songs as a term of endearment,
                                 and in Matthew as a symbol of the Holy Spirit. Doves were also acceptable burnt offerings
                                 and came to symbolize peace in early Christianity. Later literary and artistic references
                                 often draw on this association of white doves with peace, deliverance, and spiritual
                                 gifts, and are representations of the rock dove, which is highly variable in color,

                                 smooth-leaved elm
                                 or 
                                 English elm
                                 or 
                                 field elm
                                  | Genus: Ulmus | Family: Ulmaceae | Species: Ulmus procera. <br/>The so-called English elm is a deciduous tree with serrated leaves, a variety of the European field elm, introduced into England from Spain in the 16th century. Before Dutch elm disease
                                 decimated the population in the 20th century, mature elm trees were a prominent feature
                                 of mixed deciduous forests and were also frequently used in landscape gardening. In
                                 England, elms were found in mixed forests with oak and ash, often near rivers. While
                                 populations still exist, they do not grow to mature size, and so immature elms are
                                 today mainly found in hedgerows. Because of its resistance to rot, elm was frequently
                                 used to construct medieval water pipes as well as piers, jetties, and lock gates.
                                 Because of its resistance to splitting, it was also used to make chair seats, coffins,
                                 wagon wheel hubs, and bows. During the enclosure movement, elms were plants in hawthorn
                                 hedges, and avenues and groves of elms were popular features of 18th- and 19th-century
                                 landscape gardening. Wych elm, also called witch hazel or Scots elm, is also native
                                 to the UK. Ancient Roman literature spoke of a marriage between the elm and the vine, in which the elm represented the husband and the vine
                                 the wife, because of the Roman practice of planting elms in vineyards to support grape
                                 vines; in British literature, this motif appears most frequently as elm and ivy. The
                                 ancient Greek tradition of planting elms on graves has also given rise to a elm-and-death motif. They are also frequently mentioned in classical pastoral poetry, where their
                                 cool shade is praised as paradisal.—tfb, lmw<br/>
